# Problems with Learning to Code; Research 
Learning to code can be a difficult and boring process, leading to a lack of engagement and difficult to motivate learning.
Gamifying this process can make it more engaging and enjoyable, increasing the likelihood of learning.

- Gamifying processes lessens the intimidating barriers of learning a new skill

- Gamification and short-form video makes learning more engaging and enjoyable

- Incorporating game and short form content elements can increase success in continuous use. Sticky!

# Solutions
Gamify learning code and goals using game elements in apps to increase engagement and success.
Use game elements in coding apps

Add Short form content for increased engagement

Add daily challenges to practice coding

Make coding more interactive and fun for better success.

# Challenge
Create an application to increase engagement for learning to code and success

## Technical Feasibility
We have the client (Codetok) which is an app that needs to read and write videos to the server and a cdn like Fastly for loading videos from cache, avoiding  requests to the server when possible.  this is simplified.   The second part of the problem is presenting the videos to the user. There needs to be efficient pre-loaded the videos as the user scrolls that way the experience
 is seamless giving an impression of an endless feed of videos. That's just half of the  equation the other part is the recommendation engine-- an alogrithim to recomend educational content based on interests but this has too many variables  and would take way too much time to build out in this 24 hour hackathon
