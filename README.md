# Problems with Learning to Code; Research 
Learning to code can be a difficult and boring process, leading to a lack of engagement and difficult to motivate learning.
Gamifying this process can make it more engaging and enjoyable, increasing the likelihood of learning.

- Current learning is not engaging.

- Progress often feels stagnant.

- Progress is hard to track because platforms are not sticky and have an 80% bounce rate.

# Solutions
An application to increase engagement for learning to code.

- Use game elements in coding apps

- Add short form content to increase engagement

- Add periodic tracking to improve chances of success

# Challenge
Create an application to increase engagement for learning to code and success

## Technical Feasibility
We have the client (Codetok) which is an app that needs to read and write videos to the server and a cdn like Fastly for loading videos from cache, avoiding  requests to the server when possible.  this is simplified.   The second part of the problem is presenting the videos to the user. There needs to be efficient pre-loaded the videos as the user scrolls that way the experience
 is seamless giving an impression of an endless feed of videos. That's just half of the  equation the other part is the recommendation engine-- an alogrithim to recomend educational content based on interests but this has too many variables  and would take way too much time to build out in this 24 hour hackathon
